Hello Angelos,
 
I have been reading a lot of research for the past week and I have come up with the following aims and objectives.
 
Aims :
Explore the impact of vulnerabilities introduced on ICS by COTS products
Expose the attack surface and attack scenarios for ICS running COTS
Present ways to mitigate the threats
 
Objectives :
Review literature general ICS vulnerabilities
Review literature on COTS vulnerabilities
Review analysis of cyber-attack incidents related to ICS running different COTS OS
Design an assessment environment
Separate assessment ICS into layers (Hardware, Software, Network, etc.)
Create threat model on the ICS
Implement various attacks scenarios
Observe results of successful attack scenarios on different parts of ICS
Produce detection and defense mechanism/Present existing works on attack mitigation
 
This week I want to move on to researching for an appropriate configuration for the assessment environment. I found the Hardware-In-The-Loop testbed interesting. But I will have to see how that will go with further research.
I am spending a lot of time reading and I am a little worried that I might be moving a little too slow. Maybe things will move faster after I have the environment set up since I have already found sources on the vulnerabilities and attack vectors for PLC, ICS protocols, etc.

Regards,
Bua.
