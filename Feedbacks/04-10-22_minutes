Meeting 04/10/2022

- Progress report
    - Learned about ICS (SCADA, Protocols, PLC, etc.)
    - Read about COTS product
    - Learned threat modelling
    - Set up reference manager
    - Set up a private github repo
    - Gather research but have not read them all yet


- Project timeline discussions
    The timeline I proposed :
        - W3 : Read papers, Get familiar with attack vectors
        - W4 : Create experiment environment. Specific ICS running specific COTS in a simple functionality system
        - W5-6 : Design attack scenarios on different part of the environment
        - W7-8 : Implement the attack and observe result
        - W9 : Design the security control
        - W10 : Test security control
        - W11+ : TBD

    Angelos' comment : Put a lot more time into literature review. Then after that I will be able to plan better
    

Questions

- How should I explore the operations of these devices?
    - Should I research products in the market?
    - How many of them should I investigate?
    - Will these product be provided?

    Answer : I should pick specific ICS running specific COTS in a simple functionality system, preferably something I could do on my own device

- Will the outcome of the project be the security control set? How do you imagine I should conduct evaluation?

    Answer : That is one of the aim. I can test and prove that these works in the lab.


- Should we keep the same meeting time every week or should we decide week by week?

    Answer : We should have meetings when there are important update or question.

Plan for this week : Literature review

Notes :
- I should be done with practical parts by the end of January
- Do a lot of research for this month
- Place my work in comparisons to the state of the arts
- Have a big aim and devide into main objective
- Look into interaction of plc on cots : like workstation to plc.
