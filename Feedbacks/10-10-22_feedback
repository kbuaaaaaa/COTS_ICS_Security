Thank you for the update Karbongkot,
 
I believe that the aims are ok, as for the objectives, I believe that 1-3 can be one, 8-9 can be merged into one (it’s pretty much the evaluation). Nonetheless, I find the objectives to be quite broad and you could be more specific (e.g., on which setup you plan to do that etc.).
 
Also, I would recommend to create an overleaf document that you should share with me and start building up summaries for the papers you read. For each paper you could produce a small paragraph saying what/how/missing gaps of the research conducted; this way you will build you literature review. Also, it is advisable to get familiar with the latex template for L4 projects as provided by the School.
 
As for the HIL testbed, it requires the corresponding (expensive) equipment for you to do that (e.g., RTDS); that we don’t currently have; also, HIL is in general complex. Maybe focus more on Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and how they interact with COTS software.
 
Hope this helps.
 
Best regards,
Angelos
