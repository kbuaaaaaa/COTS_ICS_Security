Questions

- How should I explore the operations of these devices?
    - Should I research products in the market?
    - How many of them should I investigate?
    - Will these product be provided?

- The project description said "This project will also explore how vulnerabilities against COTS operating systems in ICS devices can impact the wider ICS". Will this be based on critical thinking or experiment?

- Will the outcome of the project be the security control set? How do you imagine I should conduct evaluation?

- I have never done forensics. Can you point me to which methods/tools I should study?

- Should we keep the same meeting time every week or should we decide week by week?
